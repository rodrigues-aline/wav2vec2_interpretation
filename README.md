# Wav2vec2.0 Interpretation
Investigating Wav2vec2.0 models context representations and the effects of fine-tuning

- This project aims to refactor the [Wav2vec2Interpretation](https://github.com/aalto-speech/Wav2vec2Interpretation) repository to improve its readability and usability, making it more accessible to new users and contributors.

- The original repository, created by [aalto-speech](https://github.com/aalto-speech), was designed to investigate the capabilities of pre-trained wav2vec2 models and compare them with fine-tuned models for speech recognition

- We thank the author for his contributions. Refactoring is essential for maintaining quality software and contributes to the growth of the development community.
